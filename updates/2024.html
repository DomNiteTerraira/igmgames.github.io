					<h2>August 22, 2024</h2>
                        <p>my laptop got broke arc has started once more</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>August 23rd patch: fixed links from going beyond site container for chromium browsers. LGPlayer13 "word-wrap: break-word;" which fixed it. Now I need to figure out a fix for the sidebars.
							<li>Yeah. For almost 24 hours the site had some broken/unfinished content as I needed to backup some files on this site late in my backup process and making those files live was the easiest way at that point. Some changes will be kept, will others will be made unacessible outside of the source code.</li>
							<li>The title by the way comes from my history of breaking laptops.</li>
							<li>Homepage updated to switch out featured games and again to replace the unfinished page with The Spinoff Game which the former used its banners from.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below. I now consider pages with all necessary parts as complete regardless of its origin and status so the numbers are a bit different.</li>
							<li>12/277 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>16/277 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>

					<h2>June 22 (B), 2024</h2>
                        <p>Story Page Changes</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>I decided to revamp the Story-Rich section (now renamed to Story Focused) to better focus on the games themselves rather than whether or not they had a story (or lore) in them or not. Previously, this made some games with stories placed in other categories and games with a non-story focus being placed in story-rich because they had some. This update should improve on fixing that issue. If not or if you see any bugs/mistakes, let me know (see about for contact information).</li>
							<li>Added the <a href = "../games/fantasy.html">Fantasy theme page</a>, the first new theme since the launch of this site.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>List Changes</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>Renamed Story-Rich to Story Focused being the first half of the replacement of the former category.</li>
							<li>New Games with Story/Lore List! It is meant to serve as the other half of the replacement, in which it lists every game with lore and/or a story. It can be accessed from the games index.</li>
							<li>Moved Void Clicker by aidenthecheeseball (Story-Rich -> Fantasy)</li>
							<li>Moved Monk Clicker (Search for Krishna) by Sun (Story-Rich -> Fantasy)</li>
							<li>Moved Project Plus Clicker by Project Plus Development Team (Story-Rich -> Humor/Joke)</li>
							<li>Moved Power Clicker by ShadowKing (Story-Rich -> Fantasy)</li>
							<li>Moved Grim by ShirtDev (Story-Rich -> Fantasy)</li>
							<li>Moved Undertale: The IdleVerse by SummonSev (Story-Rich -> Fantasy)</li>
							<li>Moved The Blacksmith by The Law (Story-Rich -> Crafting)</li>
							<li>All other Story-Rich games remained in the new Story Focused category.</li>

					<h2>June 22 (A), 2024</h2>
                        <p>Mini Update #1: Playing Your Idle Games Series Episode 2</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>Just a small update. These won't be a common thing, but will happen from time to time. The main reason this is a mini update is because I have to work on my other projects and the next planned update kind of needs to be seperate from other changes (you'll see).</li>
							<li>I noticed this while watching Episode 2 of Playing Your Idle Games that the sidebar still said "Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, not yet)" which was outdated. I changed it to "well, kind of" to better reflect the current state of the site.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below</li>
							<li>9/271 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>12/271 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>

					<h2>June 10, 2024</h2>
                        <p>A Great Day for IGM Games</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>happy pride month. I don't have anything special for you guys. IGM isn't a community known for queer stuff (haha), but I decided to feature two queer games on the home page (which happen to be mine lol). If any you guys know more, let me know.</li>
							<li>Home page also got updated to feature the recently completed pages (see below).</li>
							<li>New page making guide to replace the About section on it! If I were to complete 5 pages per month and the game count stays at 270, it will take 4 years and 5 months to finish every page. I am only doing this in my free time, so that's why I am encouraging the community to help out!</li>
							<li>Hopefully this update will have less bugs and/or mistakes.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below</li>

							<li>The above also fixes its link in the index. It was there on accident in the pervious update, and the page didn't exist yet so it led to a 404.</li>
							<li>Deleted the Games folder to prevent confusion with the games folder.</li>
							<li>Moved Grim by ShirtDev (Misc -> Story-Rich)</li>
							<li>Moved Factory Maker by TGRein (Misc -> Retail)</li>
