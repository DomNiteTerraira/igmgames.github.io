                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, kind of).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?

                    <div class="box">
                        <p>my laptop got broke arc has started once more</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>Yeah. For almost 24 hours the site had some broken/unfinished content as I needed to backup some files on this site late in my backup process and making those files live was the easiest way at that point. Some changes will be kept, will others will be made unacessible outside of the source code.</li>
							<li>The title by the way comes from my history of breaking laptops.</li>
							<li>Homepage updated to switch out featured games and again to replace the unfinished page with The Spinoff Game which the former used its banners from.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below. I now consider pages with all necessary parts as complete regardless of its origin and status so the numbers are a bit different.</li>
							<li>12/277 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>16/277 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>
