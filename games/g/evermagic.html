					<h3>Game Details</h3>
					<p>Evermagic is an unreleased story-focused game about making magic in space.</p>
					<h3>Game History</h3>
					<p>Evermagic was announced on August 9th, 2021. It was Shirt's first original game under his Shirt alias meant to be released in 5 chapters focusing on story and magic. Chapter 1 was a tutorial, with 2 and 3 focusing more on rolling the plot having 3 end in a cliffhanger.</p>
					<p>Chapter 1 was set to release in September 10th, 2021, with Chapter 2 releasing in November 11th, 3 releasing in the following January on the 28th, and 4/5 having no set dates. While the beta released on August 16th (this beta no longer exists), the game would be delayed to an unknown date the next day (although the 10th was still used). Around this time, two other games were being anticipated in the community, Bitcoin Empire by efficacy and <a href = "milk.html">Get a Glass of Milk Because You Have To</a> by Agentperson (now known as Rylie Eric), one also delayed to an unknown date and the other delayed by 5 hours (as a joke).</p>
					<p>Evermagic continued development, with sprites being posted on the igm channel on DashNet at the time, before getting a swift cancellation on August 19th due to stress related to it. Shirt commented "I tried and i have realised igm is not for me" <a href = "https://discord.com/channels/412363381891137536/412372566200549376/877974147534315520">(DashNet message link)</a>. Shirt would uncancel Evermagic before cancelling it for good on August 20th.</p>
					<p>Shirt would go on to make or contribute to other IGM games and one comic (some of which may or may not have pages here). Most didn't go anywhere. Some did, like Snowy Evening, but most didn't.</p>
