                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, kind of).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?
					<h2>Recent Update (June 22, 2024)</h2>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p>Mini Update #1: Playing Your Idle Games Series Episode 2</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>Just a small update. These won't be a common thing, but will happen from time to time. The main reason this is a mini update is because I have to work on my other projects and the next planned update kind of needs to be seperate from other changes (you'll see).</li>
							<li>I noticed this while watching Episode 2 of Playing Your Idle Games that the sidebar still said "Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, not yet)" which was outdated. I changed it to "well, kind of" to better reflect the current state of the site.
							<li>Updated the numbers below</li>
							<li>9/271 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>12/271 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>
						</ul>
						<p>List Changes</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>2nd episode of IronDizaster's Playing Your Idle Games Series released yesterday, so the page got updated as well as 2 game pages (Fake Money Clicker will be changed later in the next main update).</li>
