                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, kind of).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?
					<h2>Recent Update (June 22, 2024)</h2>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p><b>Update A:</b> Mini Update #1: Playing Your Idle Games Series Episode 2</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>Just a small update. These won't be a common thing, but will happen from time to time. The main reason this is a mini update is because I have to work on my other projects and the next planned update kind of needs to be seperate from other changes (you'll see).</li>
							<li>I noticed this while watching Episode 2 of Playing Your Idle Games that the sidebar still said "Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, not yet)" which was outdated. I changed it to "well, kind of" to better reflect the current state of the site.
							<li>Updated the numbers below</li>
							<li>9/271 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>12/271 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>
						</ul>
						<p>List Changes</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>2nd episode of IronDizaster's Playing Your Idle Games Series released yesterday, so the page got updated as well as 2 game pages (Fake Money Clicker will be changed later in the next main update).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Updated/New Pages</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li><a href = "games/g/fd.html">Forez's Dream by FrenzY</a> (Added details)</li>
							<li><a href = "games/g/tll.html">The Lost Labyrinths by LGPlayer13</a> (Added details)</li>
							<li><a href = "games/FoodS.html">Food - Sweets</a></li>

						<p>New Games</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>Fudge Clicker by Royal Chip (Existing_Win_696) (Food - Sweets)</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>Update B:</b> Story Page Changes</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>I decided to revamp the Story-Rich section (now renamed to Story Focused) to better focus on the games themselves rather than whether or not they had a story (or lore) in them or not. Previously, this made some games with stories placed in other categories and games with a non-story focus being placed in story-rich because they had some. This update should improve on fixing that issue. If not or if you see any bugs/mistakes, let me know (see about for contact information).</li>
							<li>Added the <a href = "./games/fantasy.html">Fantasy theme page</a>, the first new theme since the launch of this site.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>List Changes</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>Renamed Story-Rich to Story Focused being the first half of the replacement of the former category.</li>
							<li>New Games with Story/Lore List! It is meant to serve as the other half of the replacement, in which it lists every game with lore and/or a story. It can be accessed from the games index.</li>
							<li>See <a href = "updates.html">updates.html</a> to see where each game got moved to.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Updated/New Pages</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li><a href = "games/g/lwpd.html">Literally Watch Paint Dry by Rylie Eric</a> (Changed Story-Rich to Story Focused)</li>
							<li><a href = "games/g/milk.html">Get a Glass of Milk Because You Have To by Rylie Eric</a> (Changed Story-Rich to Story Focused)</li>
							<li>Every category page and additional list has been updated to include Fantasy and change Story-Rich (In IGM standards) to Story Focused</li>
							<li><a href = "games/growing.html">Growing</a> (Fixed Food - Sweets and Crafting links)</li>
