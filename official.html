                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, kind of).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?
					<h2>Recent Update (January 9, 2025)</h2>

							<li>Hey! It's been some time, but now I am working on this place again.</li>
							<li>2024 updates are now in the <a href = "./updates/2024.html">2024 updates</a> page.</li>
							<li>The css has been updated to use a different layout as a base, being nomnomnami's Searina template. I mainly replaced the old one with the new one and then forced some old code to the new one. After some minor struggles, I made it work.</li>
							<li>This update also fixes some scaling issues with mobile devices, such as the main content or images being bigger than the screen's width, and renames the column classes to banner.</li>
							<li>Updated the About and Guide pages to reflect the css changes.</li>
							<li>Recent Update is now constrained to a certain size (so this doesn't go beyond an entire page's content, which was an issue in the Official page).
							<li>All current Rylie Eric pages with Rylie Eric Website Universe links have been updated to use the new Projects section instead.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below.</li>
							<li>13/284 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>17/284 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>
