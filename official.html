                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, not yet).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?

                        <p>A Great Day for IGM Games</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>happy pride month. I don't have anything special for you guys. IGM isn't a community known for queer stuff (haha), but I decided to feature two queer games on the home page (which happen to be mine lol). If any you guys know more, let me know.</li>
							<li>Home page also got updated to feature the recently completed pages (see below).</li>
							<li>New page making guide to replace the About section on it! If I were to complete 5 pages per month and the game count stays at 270, it will take 4 years and 5 months to finish every page. I am only doing this in my free time, so that's why I am encouraging the community to help out!</li>
							<li>Hopefully this update will have less bugs and/or mistakes.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below</li>
							<li>6/270 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>11/270 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>
						</ul>
						<p>List Changes</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>New Featured on IronDizaster's Playing Your Idle Games Series List! It just collects all of the games from there and puts them in one spot. This wasn't requested. I (Rylie) just added it myself. It can be accessed from the games index.</li>
							<li>The above also fixes its link in the index. It was there on accident in the pervious update, and the page didn't exist yet so it led to a 404.</li>
							<li>Deleted the Games folder to prevent confusion with the games folder.</li>
							<li>Moved Grim by ShirtDev (Misc -> Story-Rich)</li>
							<li>Moved Factory Maker by TGRein (Misc -> Retail)</li>
							<li>Moved Beer Clicker by thejackb123 (Misc -> Food - Other)</li>
