                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, not yet).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?

                        <p>A Great Day for IGM Games</p>
                        <ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>happy pride month. I don't have anything special for you guys. IGM isn't a community known for queer stuff (haha), but I decided to feature two queer games on the home page (which happen to be mine lol). If any you guys know more, let me know.</li>
							<li>Home page also got updated to feature the recently completed pages (see below).</li>
							<li>New page making guide to replace the About section on it! If I were to complete 5 pages per month and the game count stays at 270, it will take 4 years and 5 months to finish every page. I am only doing this in my free time, so that's why I am encouraging the community to help out!</li>
							<li>Hopefully this update will have less bugs and/or mistakes.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below</li>
							<li>6/270 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>11/270 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>
						</ul>
						<p>List Changes</p>
						<ul style="padding-left:10px;">
							<li>New Featured on IronDizaster's Playing Your Idle Games Series List! It just collects all of the games from there and puts them in one spot. This wasn't requested. I (Rylie) just added it myself. It can be accessed from the games index.</li>
							<li>The above also fixes its link in the index. It was there on accident in the pervious update, and the page didn't exist yet so it led to a 404.</li>
							<li>Deleted the Games folder to prevent confusion with the games folder.</li>
							<li>Moved Grim by ShirtDev (Misc -> Story-Rich)</li>
							<li>Moved Factory Maker by TGRein (Misc -> Retail)</li>
							<li>Moved Beer Clicker by thejackb123 (Misc -> Food - Other)</li>

					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>This site is a place where you can find games made on Orteil's Idle Game Maker. The games mainly come from the DashNet Server, r/idlegamemaker, the discontinued forums, and possibly other places if applicable, which are then placed here for easy finding.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>If you have an issue, perhaps join the discord server? <a href = "https://discord.gg/BTwyDHBWey">https://discord.gg/BTwyDHBWey</a></p>
                    <p>If you prefer email, here you go. ericrylie at gmail dot com</p>
					<p>You can also see the code for this place <a href = "https://github.com/igmgames/igmgames.github.io">here</a>.</p>
					<h1>I want to make some things here myself!</h1>
					<p>Ok. See <a href = "guide.html">the Making Pages Guide and Terms</a>.</p>
					<p>Below is some resources from the guide if you don't want to read it.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href = "other files/game-ids.txt">Games with ids but no pages</a> (this can be changed when the game gets a page)</li>
						<li><a href = "./other files/IGMSiteTemplates.zip">The banner templates</a> with their own guide in pdn and png formats. You can use both banners, but at least one of them is required in order for the game to be in the home page and such.</li>

					<h1>Why?</h1>
					<p>Prior to Discord introducing forum channels, the DashNet channel for IGM could only pin 50 games (it's less than that since there were other pinned messages). Someone decided to combat this by making IGM games lists. That someone is the person writing this. They spend too much time doing this.</p>
					<p>This was originally a part of the IGM Fan Guide, but got moved to the r/idlegamemaker subreddit before coming here! If you're curious on the bigger history of it all, check out the <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/idlegamemaker/comments/1c8hrl8/the_igm_games_archive_site_is_now_here/">the reddit post</a> or <a href = "https://rylieeric.neocities.org/posts/2024-04-20-Announcement-igm">my personal site post</a> about it.</p>
                    <h1>Who even made this place?</h1>
                    <p>This place is managed by <b>AgentRylie</b>. She has been part of the community since 2019, and has been doing stupid lists like this since 2020. She tends to create games with some lore in them, as well as writings like this page you are reading right now. In her free time... she does the same thing because that's basically the only time she could do stuff like that.</p>
					<p>If there is no writer credit on a page, it is safe to assume Rylie wrote it.</p>
                    <p>You can see her games <a href = "./games/a/rylie-eric.html">here</a>.</p>
					<p>If you are curious, here's my setup: Notepad++ for site files, GitHub Desktop to push changes, PaintNet to draw banners, Firefox and/or Microsoft Edge to test web pages, and Google Sheets to keep track of the games list.</p>
					<h2>Additionally, I would like to credit these people.</h2>
                    <p>Layout is from <a href = "https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/">sadgrl</a></p>
					<p>Orteil</p>
                    <p>The people who were here early on: FragileFrenzy, LGPlayer13, Rein, and bup the great.</p>
