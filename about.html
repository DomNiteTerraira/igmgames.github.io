                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, kind of).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?

							<li>Hey! It's been some time, but now I am working on this place again.</li>
							<li>2024 updates are now in the <a href = "./updates/2024.html">2024 updates</a> page.</li>
							<li>The css has been updated to use a different layout as a base, being nomnomnami's Searina template. I mainly replaced the old one with the new one and then forced some old code to the new one. After some minor struggles, I made it work.</li>
							<li>This update also fixes some scaling issues with mobile devices, such as the main content or images being bigger than the screen's width, and renames the column classes to banner.</li>
							<li>Updated the About and Guide pages to reflect the css changes.</li>
							<li>Recent Update is now constrained to a certain size (so this doesn't go beyond an entire page's content, which was an issue in the Official page).
							<li>All current Rylie Eric pages with Rylie Eric Website Universe links have been updated to use the new Projects section instead.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below.</li>
							<li>13/284 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>17/284 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>

					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>This site is a place where you can find games made on Orteil's Idle Game Maker. The games mainly come from the DashNet Server, r/idlegamemaker, the discontinued forums, and possibly other places if applicable, which are then placed here for easy finding.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>If you have an issue, perhaps join the discord server? <a href = "https://discord.gg/BTwyDHBWey">https://discord.gg/BTwyDHBWey</a></p>
                    <p>If you prefer email, here you go. ericrylie at gmail dot com</p>
					<p>You can also see the code for this place <a href = "https://github.com/igmgames/igmgames.github.io">here</a>.</p>
					<h1>I want to make some things here myself!</h1>
					<p>Ok. See <a href = "guide.html">the Making Pages Guide and Terms</a>.</p>
					<p>Below is some resources from the guide if you don't want to read it.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href = "other files/game-ids.txt">Games with ids but no pages</a> (this can be changed when the game gets a page)</li>
						<li><a href = "./other files/IGMSiteTemplates.zip">The banner templates</a> with their own guide in pdn and png formats. You can use both banners, but at least one of them is required in order for the game to be in the home page and such.</li>

					<h1>Why?</h1>
					<p>Prior to Discord introducing forum channels, the DashNet channel for IGM could only pin 50 games (it's less than that since there were other pinned messages). Someone decided to combat this by making IGM games lists. That someone is the person writing this. They spend too much time doing this.</p>
					<p>This was originally a part of the IGM Fan Guide, but got moved to the r/idlegamemaker subreddit before coming here! If you're curious on the bigger history of it all, check out the <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/idlegamemaker/comments/1c8hrl8/the_igm_games_archive_site_is_now_here/">the reddit post</a> or <a href = "https://rylieeric.neocities.org/posts/2024-04-20-Announcement-igm">my personal site post</a> about it.</p>
                    <h1>Who even made this place?</h1>
                    <p>This place is managed by <b>AgentRylie</b>. She has been part of the community since 2019, and has been doing stupid lists like this since 2020. She tends to create games with some lore in them, as well as writings like this page you are reading right now. In her free time... she does the same thing because that's basically the only time she could do stuff like that.</p>
					<p>If there is no writer credit on a page, it is safe to assume Rylie wrote it.</p>
                    <p>You can see her games <a href = "./games/a/rylie-eric.html">here</a>.</p>
					<p>If you are curious, here's my setup: Notepad++ for site files, GitHub Desktop to push changes, PaintNet to draw banners, Firefox and/or Microsoft Edge to test web pages, and Google Sheets to keep track of the games list.</p>
					<h2>Additionally, I would like to credit these people.</h2>
					<p>Layout (January 2025 - Current) is from <a href = "https://nomnomnami.com/">nomnomnami</a> (Searina template)</p>
                    <p>Layout (July 2023 - January 2025), as well as some current layout code, is from <a href = "https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/">sadgrl</a></p>
					<p>Orteil</p>
                    <p>The people who were here early on: FragileFrenzy, LGPlayer13, Rein, and bup the great.</p>
