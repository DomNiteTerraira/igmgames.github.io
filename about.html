                    <h1>Who even made this place?</h1>
                    <p>This place is managed by <b>AgentRylie</b>, someone who spent too much time doing lists of igm games. She has been part of the community since 2019, and has been doing stupid lists like this since 2020. She tends to create games with some lore in them, as well as writings like this page you are reading right now. In her free time... she does the same thing because that's basically the only time she could do stuff like that.</p>
                    <p>You can see her games here. (non-existent link)</p>
