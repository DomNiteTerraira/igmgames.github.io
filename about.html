					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>This site is a place where you can find games made on Orteil's Idle Game Maker. The games mainly come from the DashNet Server, r/idlegamemaker, the discontinued forums, and possibly other places if applicable, which are then placed here for easy finding.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>If you have an issue, perhaps join the discord server? <a href = "https://discord.gg/BTwyDHBWey">https://discord.gg/BTwyDHBWey</a></p>
                    <p>If you prefer email, here you go. ericrylie at gmail dot com</p>
					<p>You can also see the code for this place <a href = "https://github.com/igmgames/igmgames.github.io">here</a>.</p>
					<h1>I want to make my game's borders myself!</h1>
					<p>Ok. <a href = "./other files/IGMSiteTemplates.zip">Here they are.</a> To submit, just contact me in the above places or do a pull request.
					<h1>Why?</h1>
					<p>Prior to Discord introducing forum channels, the DashNet channel for IGM could only pin 50 games (it's less than that since there were other pinned messages). Someone decided to combat this by making IGM games lists. That someone is the person writing this. They spend too much time doing this.</p>
					<p>This was originally a part of the IGM Fan Guide, but got moved to the r/idlegamemaker subreddit before coming here!</p>
                    <h1>Who even made this place?</h1>
                    <p>This place is managed by <b>AgentRylie</b>. She has been part of the community since 2019, and has been doing stupid lists like this since 2020. She tends to create games with some lore in them, as well as writings like this page you are reading right now. In her free time... she does the same thing because that's basically the only time she could do stuff like that.</p>
                    <p>You can see her games <a href = "./games/a/rylie-eric.html">here</a>.</p>
