                    <p>Welcome to the main page of the games list. From here, you can access some categories of games. While the Main List is the only one available right now, there's also some others planned. Here is the list.</p>
                    <h3>Main List</h3>
                    <p>The Main List contains all games released in the DashNet Discord Server since September 2019, the Idle Game Maker subreddit since 2021, and Forum Games from 2017 to 2019 seperated into different themes. Unlike the other lists, this list features a page for every game. Here are the themes.</p>

<!--                    <h3>Food Games</h3>
                    <p>Cookie Clicker but with different foods! The Food Games list takes all of the food games, regardless of their themes in the Main List, into one list.</p>
                    <h3>Forum Games</h3>
                    <p>The Forum Games list only contains games from the discontinued DashNet forums.</p>
                    <h3>Broken/Deleted Games</h3>
                    <p>The Broken/Deleted Games list only contains broken or deleted games. Does not include any from the forums simply because the site runner does't want to go back and try to find them.</p>
                    <h3>AgentRylie's Starter Pack</h3>
                    <p>This Starter Pack is a list of games to introduce you to the most popular games as well as some extras to give you the general vibe of the community. This list is curated by the site runner.</p>
