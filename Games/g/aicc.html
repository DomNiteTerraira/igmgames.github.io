					<h3>Game Details</h3>
					<p>A Ice Cream Clicker is a IGM game where you build an ice cream business. The main gimmick of the game is being able to evolve or merge ice creams to make new flavors. This game was posted in the DashNet Forums.</p>
					<p>Okay, I wouldn't do this normally in these Game Details, but I'm gonna talk about this game in the first person as who I am... Agentperson or currently known as Rylie. <a href = "https://rylieeric.neocities.org/posts/2023-01-08-PM-Pancake-Maker">I talked about in the Pancake Maker Post Mortem that I wanted to make a unique game.</a> That started here. In fact, I think part of the reason why I started making games is because I wanted my stand out ideas to actually be used. It was my first game, so I did make a basic idle game with the previously mentioned gimmick.</p>
					<p>The game launched on April 1, 2019. I think this was during my spring break, so I was putting quite a bit of time into it. I guess the lack of reponse for the game though killed my motivation for this, alongside a move that was happening later that month which complicated things. I released another updated in May 1st, but then gave up on the game shortly after and proceeded to delete the game as it had imgur images used. My quest for a unique IGM game led to Pancake Maker.</p>
					<p>Years later, my interest in the game got revived. In October 2022, I remade the game as Ice Cream Fusions. A game jam on Itch called Return to Your Roots also ran in the beginning of 2023, which got me thinking of doing a (somewhat fictional, somewhat real) backstory of this game's development. I didn't end up doing this... until 2024 with <a href = "https://rylie-eric.itch.io/neapolitan">Neapolitan</a> where I revived the idea. Those two games basically took the old idea and made it with better knowledge of what I was doing. It's not the original, but those two games still have their own charm.</p>
					<p>Anyway, A Ice Cream Clicker is something I don't regret despite how bad it is to current day me. It's... bittersweet?</p>
